Learning Tracking App with AI-Powered Mind Map

MindTrack is an AI-powered mind mapping and learning assistant. It allows users to visually organize what theyâ€™re learning, take notes under each topic, and get AI-based recommendations on when to review each concept using spaced repetition techniques.

## Features

- Create dynamic and interactive mind maps
- Add and edit notes for each topic node
- Track what you've learned and when
- Receive review reminders based on spaced repetition logic
- AI-powered suggestions for learning and retention
- Local data persistence with localStorage or IndexedDB

## Why This Project?

Most learning tools are linear and text-heavy. MindTrack combines the power of visual learning with intelligent review scheduling to help you retain what you learn more effectively. This project also demonstrates advanced React concepts and architectural design with a focus on originality.

## Tech Stack

- React (with hooks and functional components)
- Tailwind CSS (for fast and responsive styling)
- Zustand or useReducer (state management)
- react-flow or D3.js (for building the mind map)
- ChatGPT API or simulated AI response module
- localStorage or IndexedDB (for saving user data)

## Development Status

This project is currently in active development. Features are being added step-by-step, with a focus on clean code, meaningful commits, and thoughtful design.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` (or `npm start`) to launch the app

## License

This project is open source and free to use under the MIT license.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
