# mindTrack-ai-react
Learning Tracking App with AI-Powered Mind Map

MindTrack is an AI-powered mind mapping and learning assistant. It allows users to visually organize what theyâ€™re learning, take notes under each topic, and get AI-based recommendations on when to review each concept using spaced repetition techniques.

## Features

- Create dynamic and interactive mind maps
- Add and edit notes for each topic node
- Track what you've learned and when
- Receive review reminders based on spaced repetition logic
- AI-powered suggestions for learning and retention
- Local data persistence with localStorage or IndexedDB

## Why This Project?

Most learning tools are linear and text-heavy. MindTrack combines the power of visual learning with intelligent review scheduling to help you retain what you learn more effectively. This project also demonstrates advanced React concepts and architectural design with a focus on originality.

## Tech Stack

- React (with hooks and functional components)
- Tailwind CSS (for fast and responsive styling)
- Zustand or useReducer (state management)
- react-flow or D3.js (for building the mind map)
- ChatGPT API or simulated AI response module
- localStorage or IndexedDB (for saving user data)
